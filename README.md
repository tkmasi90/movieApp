## Git Branching Strategy
- One permanent branch: main
- Ephemeral feature branches area created from the main branch. Branches and merge requests should be created using GitLab Web UI via the issue board (link below). This ensures that the branch names contain automatically both, the issue number and the title.

## Project management
- GitLab issue board: https://course-gitlab.tuni.fi/compse110-fall2024/jmsk/-/boards
- Merge requests: https://course-gitlab.tuni.fi/compse110-fall2024/jmsk/-/merge_requests
