# Software Design - Group assignment
**GRADABLE VERSION TAG:** *v1.0 FINAL VERSION*

# Original idea included a feature where the user could get suggestions from AI about what movie snacks would would be suitable to be enjoyed with the selected movie. Unfortunately we were not able to implement that due to scheduling reasons.

# My contribution
- Designed and implemented the entire main view, including UI design and frontend development.
- Developed application logic and presentation logic.
- Backend: Implemented API requests and data filtering based on user selections.

## Environment
Movie Night Planner is a basic NetBeans application. A relatively recent version (e.g., 20+) can be used to build and run the application.

*Example Windows configuration:*

Product Version: Apache NetBeans IDE 20

Java: 21.0.1; OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 21.0.1+12-LTS

Runtime: OpenJDK Runtime Environment 21.0.1+12-LTS

System: Windows 11 version 10.0 running on amd64; UTF-8; en_US (nb)

1. Clone the repository and checkout the tag v1.0 with the message "FINAL DELIVERABLE" or the commit with the same message.
2. Open the project using NetBeans.
3. Choose Build from the right mouse button menu.
4. Choose Run from the right mouse button menu.

## Git Branching Strategy
- One permanent branch: main
- Ephemeral feature branches area created from the main branch. Branches and merge requests should be created using GitLab Web UI via the issue board (link below). This ensures that the branch names contain automatically both, the issue number and the title.

## Documentation
- PDF - In the folder "Documentation"
- Javadocs - In the folder "Javadoc"
